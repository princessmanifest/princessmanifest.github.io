# Hey Team ðŸŒ¸

# Haunted Places Website
This repository hosts our haunted-themed website with five data visualizations. Each visualization is self-contained within its own directory under `visualizations/`.

## Directory Structure
- `index.html`: Home page with navigation. (On main page)
- `indexX.html`: Pages for each visualization.
- `/visualizations`: Folder containing subdirectories for each visualization.

### Adding Your Visualization
1. Create a subdirectory under `/visualizations/` named after your project.
2. Add your `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`, and any related assets (e.g., data files) to the subdirectory.
3. Ensure all paths in your `index.html` are relative to your subdirectory.
4. Test your visualization locally before pushing changes.

### Testing the Site
- Test the entire site locally using a simple HTTP server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`).
- After pushing to GitHub, visit `https://princessmanifest.github.io/` to view the live site. - Note it may take some time to load... you can se when it done in the actions tab
