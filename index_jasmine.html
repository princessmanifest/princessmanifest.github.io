  <h2>Mapping Death and Delusion in America</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>What drives people to report haunted places?</strong><br>
    This visualization explores potential links between rates of Alzheimer's Disease, Drug Overdose, and Alcohol Abuse and the number of reported haunted locations across the United States.
    By selecting each cause of death, you can observe patterns that may hint at how cognitive decline, substance use, and emotional instability could influence perceptions of paranormal activity.

    <p><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> Alzheimer's Disease is associated with memory loss, confusion, and altered perceptions of reality.
    When viewing Alzheimer's rates, states like Mississippi, Washington, Vermont, Arkansas, and Texas show darker shades, indicating higher death rates.
    These regions may experience heightened vulnerabilities to cognitive distortion, potentially contributing to a greater number of haunted place reports.</p>

        <p><strong>Drug Overdose:</strong> Overdose deaths often reflect struggles with substance use and mental health challenges, both of which can affect perceptions and emotional experiences.
        In states like West Virginia, Maine, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Arizona — the darkest in overdose rates — heightened emotional instability could play a role in increased haunted place reports.</p>

      alc_normalized: `
        <p><strong>Alcohol Abuse:</strong> Chronic alcohol abuse can impair judgment, memory, and perception, possibly leading to misinterpretations of normal phenomena as paranormal.
        States like California, Texas, Louisiana, Illinois, and Massachusetts stand out both for high alcohol-related death rates and large numbers of haunted place reports, suggesting a potential overlap between substance-related cognitive effects and the spread of paranormal stories.</p>
